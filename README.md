## Octavian Rotari

####www.octavianrotari.com

I am an enthusiastic coder who graduated from Makers Academy, a highly selective coding bootcamp in London. During my time at Makers, I have discovered I have a natural aptitude for aesthetics and styling of websites and mobile applications. I am looking for a Junior Developer job in Edinburgh with a company that is fast-paced and looking to grow their market presence. I enjoy working with others and see myself fitting in a team where pairing and TDD practices are valued.

### Skills

 - Reactive: I am always adapting to new environments and situations. For example, I have moved over 7 times in my childhood and most recently have moved to the UK immersed in another language.
 - Organized: Before Maker's Academy I was working in a small start-up where the CEO was often not present. I took it upon myself to take more responsibility to ensure the smooth running of the office in his absence.
 - Collaborative: I enjoy working in teams both professionally and socially. During my time training Martial Arts I trained in a team of 4 fighters working together to achieve both common and individual goals.
